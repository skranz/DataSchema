Title: Tools for schemas describing and validating data sets
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Sebastian Kranz
Maintainer: Sebastian Kranz <sebastian.kranz@uni-ulm.de>
Description: JSON Schemas (see https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step)
  can be useful for many things like generating SQL databases, structured RDS data sets,
  validation of data, structuring AI output, creating autmatic documentation etc.
  I have used and developed several ad-hoc schema specifications / tools in different 
  packages, like "dbmisc" (yaml), "repboxdb" (yaml), rgemini (JSON schema from R).
  This package shall provide helper functions to build, convert and use schemas.
  While importa and export to json-schema is possible, it is skewed to my taste and
  my previous application.
